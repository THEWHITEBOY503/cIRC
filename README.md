### What is IRC?

IRC (Internet Relay Chat) is an online chatting protocol, first seen around 1988. Operating on internet ports 6660 through 6669 with the addition of port 7000, IRC was the father of popular online chatting services, such as Skype and Discord.

### What is cIRC?
cIRC is the 2nd service offered in the cServices series. cIRC is hosted on a Raspberry Pi 3. The maximum people that can be online on the server at once is 512 users.

### What channels are there on IRC?
IRC doesn't have a set list of channels. Anyone can make a channel as they please. To make a channel, just attempt to join a nonexistent channel. For example: `/join #channelname` would join #channelname. If #channelname does not already exist, cIRC will create #channelname and put you in it. You will become an operator of that channel.
