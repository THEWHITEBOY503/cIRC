## How do I connect?

### Downloading a client

Downloading a client is the first step in getting chatting on IRC. Any client will work. Here are the clients i use for my different platforms:

Windows- HexChat https://hexchat.github.io/

macOS- LimeChat http://limechat.net/mac/

Linux (Desktop)- Pidgin https://pidgin.im/

Linux (Terminal) Irssi https://irssi.org/download/

iOS- Mutter https://www.mutterirc.com/

Android- Revolution IRC Client https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.mrarm.irc&hl=en_US

Chrome OS- CIRC (no affiliation with cIRC services) https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/circ/bebigdkelppomhhjaaianniiifjbgocn?hl=en-US

Web Browser- IRCCloud (Note- always connected but has paid features) https://irccloud.com

### Connecting with your client

No 2 clients are the same, so setup will vary. However, if when you open your client and you are able to get to a input box where you can input a message, you will probably be able to connect to cIRC with 3 simple commands.


1- (Optional) Set your nickname.

`
/nick {nickname}
`

example:

`
/nick PersonName572
`


2- Connect to cIRC.

`
/server cservices.ddns.net
`


3- Join a channel.

If you don't know what channel you want to join, feel free to join #general

`
/join {#channel}
`

example:

`
/join #general
`


## What is cIRC services?

### What is IRC?

IRC (Internet Relay Chat) is an online chatting protocol, first seen around 1988. Operating on internet ports 6660 through 6669 with the addition of port 7000, IRC was the father of popular online chatting services, such as Skype and Discord.

### What is cIRC?
cIRC is the 2nd service offered in the cServices series. cIRC is hosted on a Raspberry Pi 3. The maximum people that can be online on the server at once is 512 users.

### What channels are there on IRC?
IRC doesn't have a set list of channels. Anyone can make a channel as they please. To make a channel, just attempt to join a nonexistent channel. For example: `/join #channelname` would join #channelname. If #channelname does not already exist, cIRC will create #channelname and put you in it. You will become an operator of that channel.
